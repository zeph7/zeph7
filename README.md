### Hi there! 

If you are reading this, know that I'm a zealeous developer. Really fond of design actually! I see patterns and colors all around us in this alluring world of ours. Similar to that beauty, I love to make the interfaces aesthetic, full of patterns and colors! Logics do excites me well, but I'm a little biased towards design. 

My motive in life is to contribute, giving back to the society. Just want to solve problems, maybe alone or aligned with any organisation. Currently I am working in an Edtech company named Smartkeeda as a Senior Android Developer. Also does some Freelancing work on the side. If you wound want to communicate with me, mail me on ashishpandey.professional@gmail.com.
